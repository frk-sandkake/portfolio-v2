# Portfolio 2.0

I'm updating the first one I did. It's not the most elegant you'll see, but it's true to me and that's a good start ;)

## Tech-stuff:

I'm using ViteJS as bundler, ReactJS as frammework and MUI as UI styler.

## Projects

Still quite new to this so they are all 'a work in progress', but please check them out and give me feedback if you see something I'm doing good or I need some help with.. <3
